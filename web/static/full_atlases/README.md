Atlasapprox: Full atlas data
============================
This folder contains full atlas data for some cell atlases used in the atlasapprox project. They are shared on a best-effort basis.

Notably, very large atlases such as Tabula Muris, Tabula Microcebus, and Tabula Sapiens are not included here. They can be found quite easily on FigShare or using the CZI Cellxgene Census interface.

The h5ad files in this folder do include cell type annotations according to the authors of the respective articles. These annotations are used as a starting point in the approximation process, however during the approximation they are modified to improve consistency and naming. The most drastic change is merging of similar cell types. The files in this folder, by contrast, contain the original cell type annotations with no modifications.

The cells in each h5ad in this folder might be a subset of all cells sequenced and discussed in each original paper. The focus here is to establish an adult, healthy cell atlas, so cells from developmental stages, disease models, genetic mutants, or other conditions are typically not included. Check out the original papers if you need those data.

Hope this is useful and good luck with your research.
