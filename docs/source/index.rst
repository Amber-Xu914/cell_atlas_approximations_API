API for cell atlas approximations
=================================
Cell atlases such as Tabula Muris and Tabula Sapiens are multi-organ single cell omics data sets describing entire organisms. A cell atlas approximation is a lossy and lightweight compression of a cell atlas that can be streamed over a RESTful API.

This documentation details two interfaces for the API:

- :doc:`RESTful <rest/index>`
- :doc:`Python <python/index>`
