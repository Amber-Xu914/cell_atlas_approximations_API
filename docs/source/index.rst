API for cell atlas approximations
=================================
Cell atlases such as Tabula Muris and Tabula Sapiens are multi-organ single cell omics data sets describing entire organisms. A cell atlas approximation is a lossy and lightweight compression of a cell atlas that can be streamed over a RESTful API.

This project enables biologists, doctors, and data scientist to quickly find answers for questions such as:

- *What is the expression of a specific gene in human lung?*
- *What are the marker genes of a specific cell type in mouse pancreas*?
- *What fraction of cells (of a specific type) express a gene of interest?*

These questions can be asked in Python or R using the provided packages (see below), or in a language agnostic manner using the REST API.

.. note::

   To access cell atlas approximations using a Human Interface (HI) instead, check out our friendly chat bot @ https://atlasapprox.org. Please be nice to the bot ðŸ˜Š - it's not very smart yet.

Version
-------
The most recent version of the API is **v1**.

API interfaces
--------------
There are five ways to access the data programmatically:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   REST (language-agnostic) <rest/index>
   Python <python/index>
   R <R/index>
   JavaScript <js/index>
   UNIX shell (bash, zsh, etc.) <sh/index>

These APIs can be used to query the approximations or to build a secondary analysis tool (e.g. a Python package that visualizes approximations).

Embedding atlas approximation data in a web page
------------------------------------------------
It is relatively easy to embed API calls to cell atlas approximations in a web page through JavaScript:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   rest/embed
